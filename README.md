Water your plants with an automated irrigation system! This is an ongoing
project under development. There is also a [companion mobile
app](https://www.github.com/pyrigate/mobile-app) under development.

**DISCLAIMER**: I am not an electrical engineer or anything of the sort, use
the instructions and code at your own risk.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the install script.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MisanthropicBit/pyrigate
$ python setup.py install
```

## Current Setup

Below is a list of hardware parts.

* Relay (prevents current flyback that could fry the Raspberry Pi board)
* 5-12V self-priming water pump
* 2 x 4mm silicone tube
* A universal power adpater
* Water tank or some other container
* Jumper wires

Future hardware:
* Moisture sensor (optional)
* Water level sensor (optional)

## TODO
